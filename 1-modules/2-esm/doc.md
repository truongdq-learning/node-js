## ES Modules
- The ES module format is the official standard format to package JavaScript code for reuse and most modern web browsers natively support the modules.
- ES modules use `import` to import modules and `export` to export modules.
- The ES module format was introduced in Node.js v8.5.0 as the JavaScript module system was standardized. Being an experimental module, the --experimental-modules flag was required to successfully run an ES module in a Node.js environment.
- The ES module format is the default module system in modern web browsers and Node.js v13.2.0 and later.
